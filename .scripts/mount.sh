# Mount your LinkÃ¶ping University (LiU) home directory under ${MOUNT_POINT}. The mount point is created with sshfs,
# which requires kernel config CONFIG_FUSE_FS and the userspace programs libfuse and sshfs. The LiU home directory is
# mounted under ${MOUNT_POINT} and uses one of the FIL-LAGER servers filur0[0-7].it.liu.se. The FIL-LAGER servers are
# only accessable from within the university network. The script (sshfs) will prompt you for your LiU password. The
# mount point is un-mounted from the command line with `umount ${MOUNT_POINT}`
