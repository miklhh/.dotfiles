# .dotfiles 🏠

My dotfiles repository. [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) is used to create symlinks from `${HOME}` to
this directory by running the `./install` shell script. Running `./install` will not overwrite or remove any
existing configuration from the home directory and will instead warn that one or more files can not be symlinked while
executing.
